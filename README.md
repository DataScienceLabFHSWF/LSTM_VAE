This repository is the codebase for the scientific paper: Variational-Autoencoder Architectures for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Processes

In this paper we describe the use of Variational-Autoencoderarchitectures for the unsupervised detection of anomalies in industrialprocesses. To this end we implement a Variational Long Short-TermMemory (LSTM) Autoencoder and a Convolutional Variational Atten-tion Autoencoder with TensorFlow and TensorFlow-Probability and trainit on a variation of the Tennessee-Eastman dataset. We then constructan anomaly score from the Variational Autoencoderâ€™s output makinguse of the Bayesian properties of the trained model. Using the anomalyscore and the autoencoder output we then perform a simple binaryclassification in order to evaluate the improvement of our method overgeneric classifications. This model is benchmarked against supervisedAutoML and a Convolutional Variational Attention Autoencoder. Wefind that Variational-LSTM-Autoencoder and Convolutional VariationalAttention Autoencoder yield promising results in unsupervised anomalydetection and lay groundwork for more complex use cases in industryapplications.
